# Wireframing

## What is a wireframe?
A wireframe is something you use when you first begin designing a website to get an idea of the layout you will be using for the final project. A wireframe is **very simple**. It usually consists of lines, boxes, and basic text.

There are generally **two** types of wireframes:

hand drawn wireframes are usually the first things you will use. The beginnings of many website designs start as hand drawn sketches. These are good because (if you are in an **in-person** work environment) you can easily show the design to your stakeholders and make changes on the fly.

Digital wireframes are **just as good** as hand drawn wireframes (I usually prefer them). There are a few websites that are commonly used for wireframing which I will list below. These wireframes follow the same basic principals as the hand drawn ones. They are a series of boxes, lines, and text that give a basic idea of layout. These do not usually have color, pictures, actual content, or even any functionality.

## Why do we use wireframes?
Developers use wireframes to create their structure when creating a web page. Every website is made up of a whole bunch of boxes that have stuff in them. The structure of each of those boxes is called the **box model** which will be gone over a little bit later in the markdown.

# HTML Tags

## \<html>
The `html` tag is the top level tag for telling the internet that the file it is looking at is an `html` file.

---

## \<head>
The `head` tag is **never** seen by the user who visits the website. It is information that is used to add **CSS** files to be used, **JavaScript** files to be used, and other various things.

---

## \<title>
The `title` tag goes inside the `head` tag and is the **only** piece of the `head` tag that can be seen by the user. This is the tag that is used to determine what is shown in the **tab** at the top of the screen.

---

## \<body>
The `body` tag is where the majority of your **html** code is going to go. All of the **content** of your page goes inside of this tag.

---

## Header Tags
**Header tags** are formatted as `<h1>` and the numbers range from `1` to `5`. These are **NOT** used for formatting, even though the page automatically applies formatting to them based on their number. These are primarily used for **screen readers** to be able to tell what on the page is more important than something else. It is important to note that the `<h1>` tag can only be used **once** on the page and is for the *MOST IMPORTANT** thing on the page, such as the title of an article. The other numbers can be used at will.
