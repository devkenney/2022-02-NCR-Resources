# WELCOME!

## How to use this resource
First: Clone this repository to your computer!

Once you have cloned this repo, you will be able to pull all of my changes from github every time I add something. (I will be uploading notes from class every day in the form of 'cheatsheet' markdown files.)

If you have any trouble viewing the markdowns or need help with anything else, my office hours are as follows:

| Day | Time |
| ----- | ----- |
| Tuesday: | 1:00 PM - 3:00 PM |
| Friday: | 3:00 PM - 5:00 PM |
